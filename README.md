# luaPP
Simple library that enhances the lua C api with some C++ features, efficiently shortening the code and hopefully reducing crashes in your application.
The library adds classes that make it possible to represent the lua stack as C++ objects, thus gives the possibility to manipulate and store them more efficiently. I explained most of the methods in the luaStack.hpp file.
Mind that the whole library is possibly bit underdeveloped, but whenever I need any new feature, I just add it here. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me or fork the repo. P.S. the install script is probably very bad, it's here because I use it. Still, I discourage anyone from using it, a manual install would be a lot safer.
